# Usage and limits

Open **Usage** from the sidebar or the command palette, or press `mod+u` on web and
desktop when the terminal is not focused. Customize `usage.open` in
**Settings → Keybindings**.

## Understand your usage

**Usage** reads Pi session history from your connected environments. It shows token use,
cache savings, model breakdowns, and estimated API-equivalent cost. These estimates are
not your subscription bill. Provider-reported costs without public rates appear as **Other**.
Select a model under **Breakdown** to see its trend, cache hit rate, and cost per million tokens.

Usage includes each configured Pi instance's history, including disabled instances.
Set `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` in an instance's environment to read a different Pi home.
Use an absolute or `~/` path; accounts sharing a session directory count once.
Saved totals survive transcript cleanup. Old cached usage remains readable.

When your app and server support different providers, usage totals may cover only the providers
your app understands. Update the app to include newly supported providers.

On web and desktop, use the environment dropdown to filter costs, tokens, and limits. All
environments are selected by default. The dropdown shows which environments are still scanning;
results appear as each one responds.

If recent work is missing or a new model shows no cost, refresh to rescan session history and
update model pricing.

## Set custom model prices

On web or desktop, open the environment dropdown on **Usage**, then choose **Model prices** to add,
edit, or reset a model's estimated price. **Apply to** starts with your current Usage filter;
choose all environments or select individual destinations. Enter the exact model ID and USD
rates per million input and output tokens. You can enter any model ID, including models
without public pricing. When a model on **Usage** has no known price, select it under
**Breakdown** and choose **Set price** to open this table with that model added.

Cache read and cache write rates are optional and use the input rate when blank. Enter `0` for
tokens that are free. Saved prices replace automatic pricing for all of that environment's
history and are shared with clients connected to it. When environments have different prices,
cells show **Mixed**. Edit rates directly in the table, then choose **Save changes** to apply all
edited rows. Untouched cells keep each environment's rate. Select one environment to inspect its
prices. **Reset to automatic** marks a model's override for removal when you save; you can undo
it before saving.

To count one model as another, such as a preview model under its released name, enter the target
model ID under **Map to**. The mapped model no longer appears on **Usage**: its tokens and cost
move to the target model and use the target's price. Clear **Map to** or reset the row to show
the model on its own again.

Each destination reports whether the change saved. Offline or unavailable environments are
marked **Not saved**. Reconnect them and choose **Retry failed saves** to finish the same change
without writing again to environments that already saved. Changes are not queued after you close
the dialog.

## Track subscription limits

**Usage → Limits** pools every subscription account it can see per provider, so with several Codex
or Claude accounts across your environments and hubs you read one number per window rather than a
list. Each window card shows how much of the pool is left and a bar with one segment per account,
kept in the same column across windows. Accounts are ordered by their 5-hour reset, soonest
first, or by the first available window when no account reports a 5-hour limit. A gap means the
account does not report that window. When the provider reports reset times, the card also says
when the next reset lands and how much it hands back. The hatched
part of a segment is what that reset restores. Tap a segment or account row for the account's plan,
where it is signed in, and its reset time. On web, you can hover too. Codex and Claude accounts
with banked reset credits show a ticket count and the **Use reset** action in the account details.
Claude resets are not available when the server runs on macOS, where Claude keeps its login in the
Keychain. On narrow screens, numbered rows below
the bar show each account's quota, countdown, and credits. Tap a row to open its details.

The same account signed in on more than one environment, or reported by a hub as well, counts once.
Filter with the environment dropdown to see what a single machine has.

Opening Limits checks the selected connected environments automatically. Each client waits at
least five minutes between automatic checks of an environment, including after a failed check.
If a window still looks stale, refresh Limits to re-check every provider and hub.

Pick `/usage-limits` from the composer's command menu, or send it as a message, to check the
current model's limits without leaving the conversation. The result opens above the composer and
closes when you dismiss it or send your next message. It uses the same snapshot as **Usage → Limits**, so it does not run the agent or refresh
anything. The command is offered only for providers that appear under **Usage → Limits**.

Pi token history does not expose subscription quotas. Connect a CLIProxyAPI hub to
view supported account limits. API-key accounts may not report subscription limits.

## Connect a CLIProxyAPI hub

To see pooled accounts, open **Settings → Providers → Usage providers → Add hub**. Choose the
environment that will connect to the hub and enter its URL and management key.

The accounts appear under **Usage → Limits**. Codex accounts show banked reset credits; select an
account and choose **Use reset** to redeem one. No hub plugin is required.

This connection supplies usage information; configure
the provider separately to send agent requests through the hub. Remove the hub from the same
settings section when you no longer need it.

## Subscription usage widget

Add **Subscription usage** from your iOS or Android widget gallery to see remaining Codex and
Claude quotas. Tap it to open **Usage → Limits**; on Android this works while T3 is running in
the background, otherwise open the app from the launcher. On iOS, use **Edit Widget** to choose
Session, Weekly, or both for each provider. Reopen T3 to refresh expired readings.

## Keyboard shortcuts

On web and desktop, open Usage from the command palette. While on Usage,
press `C`, `T`, or `L` for Cost, Tokens, or Limits while not typing in a field.
Use `Ctrl+Shift+1/2/3/4` (`Cmd+Shift+1/2/3/4` on macOS) for the past
24 hours, 7 days, 30 days, or 90 days. Period shortcuts do nothing on Limits.
Press `Escape` to return to the previous page. Customize these shortcuts in
**Settings → Keybindings**.
