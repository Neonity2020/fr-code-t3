# Welcome wizard

T3 Code shows a setup flow when you open a new installation or connect to the
hosted app for the first time. Existing workspaces skip this flow.

## Connect your computers

Select one or more computers to set up. If you opened T3 Code directly from a
server or the desktop app, that computer is already connected and selected.
It is identified by its name, which may differ from the device running your
browser.

You can add more computers before continuing:

- **T3 Connect** connects computers that are signed in to your account.
  [Install the CLI](./install.md#command-line) and run `t3 connect` on each
  computer you want to add, then start T3 Code or run `t3 serve` so the
  computer stays available.
- **Add a computer** connects directly to a server on your network or tailnet.
  Start the server with `t3 serve`, then run `t3 pair --tailscale` and paste
  the pairing link. You can also run `t3 serve --host <address>` and use
  `t3 pair` when the server is already reachable on your network.

Saved computers and computers discovered through T3 Connect are selected by
default. Uncheck any you do not want to set up; this does not disconnect them.
Continue when your selected computers are connected. Setup checks
agents across the selected computers, then offers project import grouped by computer.

If T3 Code cannot confirm the workspace during startup, the setup flow shows
**Still connecting** instead of opening the app. Select **Reload** to try again.

If T3 Code cannot read your saved settings, it shows **Could not read settings**.
Select **Retry** after storage becomes available. Setup does not replace
unreadable settings with defaults.

## Check your agents

FR Code checks each selected computer for Pi. If Pi is missing, open the setup
terminal to install `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent`. Run Pi interactively and use
`/login` or your usual API-key configuration before refreshing its status.

The setup terminal uses the home directory and environment configured for the
selected provider instance. Sensitive values remain redacted in Settings and
terminal metadata while the terminal process can use them.

## Import your projects

FR Code finds directories recorded in Pi sessions. Git repositories
are listed first, newest activity on top. When the remote is on GitHub, the
group shows the repository as `owner/name`. Clones with the same remote share
one group. Directories that are not git repositories sit under "Other folders".

The default selection includes git repositories active within the last 30 days
with at least three conversations. Use the checkboxes, or "Select all" and
"Select none", to change the selection. Linked git worktrees, Codex scratch
directories under `Documents/Codex`, and anything under `Downloads` are not
offered.

A large or malformed history can reach the scan limit. T3 Code keeps the
projects it found and warns when projects or conversations may be missing.

Imported projects include Pi conversations. You can continue their native session
files in FR Code.

Conversation import follows Pi's active session branch and includes visible user and
assistant messages. It omits reasoning, tool activity, and attachments. It reads one
conversation at a time, skips files larger than 16 MiB or 20,000 records, and skips
unreadable, cyclic, or unparseable conversations.

Each import attempt reads up to 100 conversation files and 64 MiB per project,
Run import again to continue a large batch.
Completed conversations are not imported again. You can continue without the
remaining history.

You can continue without configuring agents or importing projects, or return to an earlier step
using the setup progress bar. Navigation pauses while an import is running.
